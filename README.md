Image Classification with Deep Learning Models
This repository contains code for performing image classification using deep learning models, specifically ResNet. The goal is to classify images into predefined categories or classes based on their visual content.

Overview
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves training a model to recognize and assign labels to images. Deep learning models, such as ResNet (Residual Neural Network), have proven to be highly effective for this task due to their ability to learn complex representations of images.

Getting Started
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Prepare your dataset: The images should be organized into separate directories based on their corresponding classes or categories.
Train the model: Run the training script train.py, which loads the ResNet model, preprocesses the data, and trains the model using the provided dataset.
Evaluate the model: After training, the model can be evaluated using the test set to measure its performance in terms of accuracy and loss.
Predict with the model: You can use the trained model to make predictions on new unseen images by running the prediction script predict.py.
Model Architecture
The ResNet model is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that introduces skip connections or shortcuts to overcome the vanishing gradient problem during training. This enables the network to effectively learn and represent complex features in images. The pretrained ResNet model used here can be fine-tuned for the specific classification task.

Hyperparameter Tuning
The hyperparameters such as learning rate, weight decay, and batch size play a crucial role in training the model effectively. This project utilizes Optuna, an automatic hyperparameter optimization framework, to search for the best combination of hyperparameters. It performs a systematic search to find the hyperparameter values that maximize the accuracy of the model.

Results
The trained model achieves high accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying images. The performance metrics, including accuracy, loss, and other evaluation metrics, are logged during the training process for analysis and comparison.

Conclusion
Image classification using deep learning models like ResNet enables accurate and automated classification of images based on their visual content. This project provides a framework for training, evaluating, and predicting with deep learning models for image classification tasks. Feel free to explore and extend the code for your specific needs.
